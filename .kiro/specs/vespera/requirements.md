# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a custom Fedora Atomic image called "Vespera" based on the Aurora variant. The image will include a customized package list (removing some Aurora packages and adding preferred alternatives as RPMs or Flatpaks) and integrate the maccel mouse acceleration driver. The entire process will be automated through GitHub Actions to generate updated images daily.

## Glossary

- **Vespera Image**: The custom Fedora Atomic image being created (named after the Latin word for "evening", complementing Aurora's "dawn")
- **Aurora**: A Fedora Atomic variant that serves as the base for the custom image
- **Fedora Atomic**: An immutable operating system based on Fedora Linux
- **Maccel Driver**: A mouse acceleration kernel driver from https://github.com/Gnarus-G/maccel
- **Package Customization**: Process of removing Aurora packages and adding preferred RPM/Flatpak alternatives
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform for automated daily image builds
- **Container Build System**: The system used to build and package the custom image using containerized builds
- **Image Registry**: A repository where the built image will be stored and distributed

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create a custom Fedora Atomic image based on Aurora, so that I can deploy a standardized immutable operating system with specific packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vespera Image SHALL be based on the Aurora Fedora Atomic variant
2. THE Container Build System SHALL produce a bootable immutable operating system image
3. THE Vespera Image SHALL maintain compatibility with Fedora Atomic tooling and workflows
4. THE Container Build System SHALL generate image metadata including version and build information
5. THE Vespera Image SHALL support standard Fedora Atomic update mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the Aurora package list by removing unwanted packages and adding preferred alternatives, so that I can create a tailored system with my preferred software stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Container Build System SHALL start with the Aurora base recipe and package list
2. THE Container Build System SHALL remove specified packages from the Aurora base configuration
3. THE Container Build System SHALL add specified RPM packages to replace removed Aurora packages
4. THE Container Build System SHALL add specified Flatpak applications as alternatives to Aurora packages
5. THE Container Build System SHALL resolve all package dependencies and conflicts during customization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the maccel mouse acceleration driver included in the image, so that I can have enhanced mouse control and acceleration features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Container Build System SHALL clone the maccel driver source from https://github.com/Gnarus-G/maccel
2. THE Container Build System SHALL build the maccel kernel module from source during image creation
3. THE Container Build System SHALL integrate the maccel kernel module into the Vespera Image
4. THE Vespera Image SHALL load the maccel kernel module automatically at boot
5. THE Vespera Image SHALL provide maccel driver functionality for mouse acceleration control

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want an automated GitHub Actions workflow that checks daily for upstream changes and only builds when necessary, so that I can maintain up-to-date images without wasting resources on unchanged builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL trigger automatically on a daily schedule
2. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL check for new Aurora base image versions before building
3. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL check for maccel software updates before building
4. WHEN upstream changes are detected, THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL build the Vespera Image
5. WHEN no upstream changes are detected, THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL skip the build process
6. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL publish successful builds to a container registry only when changes exist
7. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL generate build logs indicating whether changes were detected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to deploy and run the custom Vespera image, so that I can use the specialized operating system with customized packages and mouse acceleration features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vespera Image SHALL boot successfully on target hardware platforms
2. THE Vespera Image SHALL provide access to all customized RPM and Flatpak packages
3. THE Vespera Image SHALL provide maccel mouse acceleration functionality through standard interfaces
4. THE Vespera Image SHALL support standard Fedora Atomic management commands (rpm-ostree, etc.)
5. THE Vespera Image SHALL maintain system stability and security characteristics of Fedora Atomic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the project to be version controlled and publicly available on GitHub, so that others can contribute, fork, and use the automated build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Project Repository SHALL be hosted on GitHub with public access
2. THE Project Repository SHALL contain all configuration files for image customization
3. THE Project Repository SHALL include documentation for setup and usage
4. THE Project Repository SHALL provide GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds
5. THE Project Repository SHALL support community contributions through standard GitHub workflows
